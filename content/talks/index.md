| Chemometrics | Evolutionary search in NIR spectral libraries  | We propose a new genetic algorithm to select informative samples from diverse spectral libraries, crafting precise custom models for specific target populations. The algorithm iteratively refines subsets using partial least squares (PLS) models, guided by target population and distance measures. | 08/2023 |   Not public available    |
| Software Engineering + Data Science | Introducing R-based open source software and web services into traditional company structures | Crafting effective NIR predictive models for customer contentment is tough due to cost, customization, and time issues. Internal tools facilitate rapid model creation. To progress the NIR industry, integrating diverse teams, open-source chemometrics software, and transparent practices is vital for innovation and improved customer satisfaction. | 11/2022 | Not public available |
